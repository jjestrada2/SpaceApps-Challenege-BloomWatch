## Deploying on Kubernetes

We use a Kubernetes environment provisioned by [Helm charts](https://helm.sh/). Any Kubernetes distribution works.

Images are kept in your private registry, so the cluster can function with zero outbound traffic.

### Disconnected LLM and GPU requirements

Air-gapped Mundi is designed to be used with a variety of GPUs and models. For some users, this may mean using small models on a small GPU, trading degraded LLM performance for lower infrastructure costs. Or, if you have access to high-end data center GPUs, we can help you use frontier models.

If your organization has an air-gapped LLM already, Mundi can likely make use of that.

Depending on your needs, we can benchmark different models for you and determine the right approach. Reach out to us and we can help guide you to the best solution.

### Features impacted when air gapped
- **OpenStreetMap** downloads are disabled.
- **MapTiler** is replaced with a locally hosted [OpenMapTiles](https://openmaptiles.org/) deployment.
- **External SQL database connections** outside the air gapped network are not available.
- **Collaboration between users** is possible but would require custom engineering. Contact us for more information.
- **SSO** is complex but possible and requires self-hosting something like Authentik.
